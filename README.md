#### _my personal online home and portfolio_

This is my personal website. I'm building it mostly for fun, but also for front end development practice, and to have a place to put my coding projects and my hobbies. Feel free to poke around but don't judge it too hard.

### Site Structure
Haven't figured it out yet lol. Give me a minute I just started

### Site Deployment
Currently, for ease of testing, deployment, flexibility, and the free cost, I'm deploying this website through Cloudflare's Pages features. Simply by pushing/pulling to the main branch of this GitHub Repo, the website will be automatically build and deployed. Other branches are also deployed at preview addresses.
